Welcome to Rt1_assignment2_documentation's documentation!
=========================================================
On this repository, I have the privilege to share with you my modest response to the Research Track's second assignment, wherein we are tasked to build a package for a robot simulation in Gazebo and Rviz. Therefore, I did create a new ROS package, for which we will develop 3 nodes to perform specific tasks as follows:

    1-An action client node that permits the user to set or cancel a target (x, y) and also publishes the robot's position and velocity as a custom message (x, y, vel x, vel y), by using the values published on the subject /odom.

    2-A service node that when we activate, it will print the number of target reached and cancelled.

    3-A node for printing both the distance that separates the robot from the target and its average speed. In addition, It subscribes to the robotâ€™s position and speed, this will be through using a custom message. A parameter will be used to set the frequency of publishing the data.

    4-In order to run all the simulation together, a launch file was created for this purpose. Set the value for the frequency of the information published by node 3
